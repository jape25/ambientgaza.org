    <h2>Outline</h2>
    <p>Ambient Gaza is an immersive music and sound mapping project weaving in soundscapes from Gaza before the current
      wave of destruction. From marketplaces and olive harvests to beachside play, each piece captures fragments of
      everyday life‚Äîoffering a space to listen, to grieve, and to stand with those still living and dreaming in
      Palestine.</p>
    <p>The music is an act of non-erasure: a refusal to forget, a recognition of Palestinian humanity. It invites
      listeners to carry these sounds within their bodies‚Äîuntil they can once again resonate in the places and lives
      from which they came.</p>

    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>We're honoured that Ambient Gaza is gaining traction, including being part of this year's Glastonbury Festival.
      It's more than a booking ‚Äî it's a bold signal of solidarity with our message: a refusal to erase, a call for
      peaceful resistance, and a recognition of the humanity and rights of Palestinians in the face of one of the
      gravest atrocities of our time.</p>
    <p>As the world tips further into corruption and instability, we believe art still holds power ‚Äî to witness, to
      connect, and to break through oppression with quiet, resonant truths. Ambient Gaza is our offering to that
      movement: sound as solidarity, listening as resistance.</p>
    <p>Gaza is going through a genocide, live. We are being gaslit by our leaders and news media, who want us to just
      ignore the fact that they are participating in genocide. People around the world are desperate for ways to support
      and respond to the crisis, and ways to show solidarity with Palestinian people. This is one of the ways we can
      respond. Buy the album, follow the project on instagram, and share the project with as many people as possible.

    <h2>Sound Map: Voices from Gaza</h2>
    <p>This interactive map preserves the voices and testimonials of survivors from Gaza, creating a living archive of
      experiences that refuse to be erased. Each point on the map represents a story, a life, a moment of resistance
      through remembrance.</p>

    <h2>Fundraising</h2>
    <p>Money raised has so far been donated to Unicef Gaza Emergency Appeal, British Red Cross / Palestine Red Crescent
      Society (PRCS), Oday Halawa Fund, Project Pure Hope, United4Gaza, All Our Relations, Ghosoon Al-Khair and Sumud Educational Hub. The original fundraising model for Ambient Gaza was
      streaming royalties, however it has been censored by Spotify,
      with repeated artist claims denied for no reason other than it is pro Palestinian. The album is available to buy
      on Bandcamp on the link at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>
    <p>Ambient Gaza is actively seeking soundscapes of Gaza pre-destruction, testimony from Gazans in Gaza, displaced
      and in the diaspora. The Collective invites contributions from new artists for the upcoming Ambient Gaza Vol. 2.
      All soundscapes will be vetted for due diligence pre-release so that no person can be personally identified or
      located. The Collective will remain anonymous, centring listening over any public recognition. The collective will
      also create an installation and interactive map for the project, centring lived experiences of Palestinian people,
      soundscapes and life stories from locations in Gaza.</p>
